# angular-es6-jspm-babel-example

This is a simple example of using [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/) with [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) syntax and compiling it all into a bundle using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and workflow using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).


## Install dependencies

```
npm install

jspm install
```



## Steps to run this project
1. ```npm install```
2. ```jspm install```
3. ```gulp```
4. To view the page that used SFX javascript bundle - ```http://localhost:8080/index.html```
5. To view the page that uses async logic - ```http://localhost:8080/index-async.html```
6. To view the page that uses sync logic - ```http://localhost:8080/index-main.html```
7. To test this project ```npm run test``` OR ```karma start karma.config.js```



## Steps to create similar new project
1. ```npm init```
2. ```npm install --save-dev jspm live-server phantomjs jasmine jasmine-core karma karma-jasmine karma-phantomjs-launcher karma-jspm karma-babel-preprocessor istanbul karma-coverage isparta karma-sourcemap-loader```
3. ```jspm init``` (note: select babel during the setup, name config file as jspm.config.js)
4. ```jspm install npm:angular@^1.4.7 npm:angular-route@^1.4.7```
5. Now configure your karma.conf.js file using [this guide](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/configuration.html)
6. To generate karma conf file - ```karma init karma.config.js```




## Notes
1. When you create a directive, make sure to use the ES6 syntax. Also make sure to create a directive factory to create an instance of the directive to register in the angular app module. As follows:
Directive factory which create an instance
```
static directiveFactory($q){
        OneDirective.instance = new OneDirective($q);
        return OneDirective.instance;
    }
```
Directive factory is invoked to register the directive
```
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [
	...
]);

myApp.directive('one', OneDirective.directiveFactory);

```

. 
2. Regarding jspm bundle, 

In the gulpfile.js, 'jspm:bundle' task injects the bundle to jspm.config.js; this creates/updates a variable named "bundles" in jspm.config.js.

Following is the code snippet of 'bundles' variable:
```
bundles: {
    "dist/main.js": [
      "src/app.js",
      "npm:angular@1.4.7",
      "npm:angular-route@1.4.7",
      "src/view1/view1.js",
      "src/view2/view2.js",
      "src/components/one/one.js",
      "npm:angular@1.4.7/index",
      "npm:angular-route@1.4.7/index",
      "npm:angular@1.4.7/angular",
      "npm:angular-route@1.4.7/angular-route",
      "github:jspm/nodelibs-process@0.1.2",
      "github:jspm/nodelibs-process@0.1.2/index",
      "npm:process@0.11.2",
      "npm:process@0.11.2/browser"
    ]
  },
```

To observe the difference with & without bundle, you have to manually remove that "bundles" variable from "jspm.config.js" file. 

* If "jspm.config.js" has been configured with bundles, then load "index-async.html" OR "index-main.html" with developer tool open, observe the network, you will see single bundle 'main.js' getting downloaded, no other .js files are downloaded.

* If "jspm.config.js" doesnot have bundles, then load "index-async.html" OR "index-main.html" with developer tool open, observe the network, you will see multiple javascript files downloaded instead of single bundle.
![no-bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidnan/angular-es6-jspm-babel-example/master/images/no-bundle.png)

JSPM bundle just bundles all the modules used into single file, still we need to import systemjs and config js. JSPM bundle SFX bundles are the files modules, systemjs, config js into single file which can be script imported in HTML. Bundle helps to reduce the number of requests, there by improve page load time. For more information on bundle and bundle SFX, refer [jspm.io](http:/jspm.io)

# angular-es6-jspm-babel-example

This is a simple example of using [Angular 1.x](https://angular.org/) with [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) syntax and compiling it all into a bundle using [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and workflow using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).


## Install dependencies

```
npm install

jspm install
```



## Steps to run this project
1. ```npm install```
2. ```jspm install```
3. ```gulp```
4. To view the page that used SFX javascript bundle - ```http://localhost:8080/index.html```
5. To view the page that used javascript loaded async - ```http://localhost:8080/index-async.html```



## Steps to create similar new project
1. ```npm init```
2. ```npm install --save-dev jspm live-server```
3. ```jspm init``` (note: select babel during the setup, name config file as jspm.config.js)
4. ```jspm install npm:angular@^1.4.7 npm:angular-route@^1.4.7```



## Notes
1. When you create a directive, make sure to use the ES6 syntax. Also make sure to create a directive factory to create an instance of the directive to register in the angular app module. As follows:
Directive factory which create an instance
```
static directiveFactory($q){
        OneDirective.instance = new OneDirective($q);
        return OneDirective.instance;
    }
```
Directive factory is invoked to register the directive
```
var myApp = angular.module('myApp', [
	...
]);

myApp.directive('one', OneDirective.directiveFactory);

```
